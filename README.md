You asked, we delivered -- The ever so popular Fronk Frizby is finally starring in his own game. Wow!

Drink, swig and glug your way through a whimsical turn-based RPG. Battle unsettling enemies, encounter familiar faces and confront the most sinister foe of all: your addiction to caffeine.

*This was originally intended as a regular jam entry, but it proved difficult to finish during that time frame, which is why we opted for the "Extra" category. In total, we spent around 4 days making this... whatever this is.*
